                <p>I believe that great narration begins by not thinking of oneself as a narrator.  My goals have always been: to sound human, capture the distinct individual qualities that make your story unique, and rehearse, rehearse, rehearse the text.  There is no other way to understand the heart of your writing.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I am 100% self taught, and I like to create my own work.  In 2015, after being cast back-to-back in two films in Boston, I felt motivated to move to Los Angeles.  I quickly became a YouTube content creator and would go on for the next 7 years to make over 400 comedy videos that have earned more than 200 million total views and 900,000+ subscribers.  In that time I have acted in a variety of feature films, short films, TV shows, and voiced multiple characters on Netflix.  Now, my focus is producing audiobooks at the highest quality.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I am so fortunate to work with new and established clients who make it possible for me to make a living with my voice.</p>
